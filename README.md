# Kaggle-Notebook-First-Data-Preprocessing-Project
This was my very first data preprocessing project and I also used this project as a submission for school. 
I enjoyed learning more into what the process is when cleaning data, removing missing values, and overall just shape into a subset where I can find trends to a specific question.
Creating models was a bit difficult since I was still learning about the seaborn and pandas libraries, but I really enjoyed getting to mess around with them
and seeing what does what to better structure the models/plots.

The dataset is owned by Sahil Bajaj from Kaggle and contains the prices and other characteristics of almost 54,000 diamonds. 
The dataset includes features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price and its diamond grading.
