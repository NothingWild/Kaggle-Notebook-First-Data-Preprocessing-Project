# Kaggle-Notebook-First-Data-Preprocessing-Project
This was my very first data preprocessing project and I also used this project as a submission for school. 
I enjoyed learning more into what the process is when cleaning data, removing missing values, and overall just shape into a subset where I can find trends to a specific question.
Creating models was a bit difficult since I was still learning about the pandas and seaborn libraries, but I really enjoyed getting to mess around with them
and seeing what does what to better structure the models/plots.
